You buy an avocado (or three). You trim tomato, onion, and chilli to pieces  and place them in a bowl.
Cut into slices your avocado and place them in a deep bowl.
Stirrrr that beautiful green avocado until it starts to take on a less solid shape. 
It should be a delicious mix of green dip and pieces of avocado by now. 
Take the cut vegetable mix from before and throw it into the stirred avocado bowl around the place so it looks beautiful.
Then mix once again to make sure everything is mixed together. 
Suddenl a wild guacamole appears, and a delicious one at that as well. 

:) enjoy!!
